                The story of Lawrence's trees begins with a look at change over time. A line chart showcases the undulating journey of tree planting rates, highlighting the overall tree planed count over the years? This chart doesn't give us the full picture. Supplementing the line chart, a bar graph breaks down the data annually, offering a more granular view. Here, we can see the exact numbers. We dive a bit deeper, by adding the heat map, giving us another dimension; seasonality patterns. We see here that the chart reveals that June and November are popular planting months. The temporal lenses gives a good intial insight, but also raises more questions.

            Lawrence's map, dotted with clusters, paints a picture of the pockets of trees. The density map highlights regions buzzing with trees, while others appear sparse. The different colored lines represent the trees that share the same street, showcasing clusters. The bar charts take this analysis a step further, ranking streets by their green footprint. The juxtaposition of streets with the greatest and smallest density throws light on the urban planning and perhaps even the socio-economic factors at play. However, here we fail to see the divesrity of trees and how the planting of the trees changes over time.

            Beyond the numbers and locations, the types of trees reveal another facet of the story. The nested pie chart unfurls the diversity. The outer circle represents the Genus, and the inner circle represents the spieces. It also showcases the top 10 Genera. While some species dominate the landscape, others make only a fleeting appearance. The bar chart offers a straightforward ranking of species by popularity, while the tree map provides a visual representation of diversity, with each species occupying a space proportional to its prevalence.

            <h5><em>How do tree planting rates correlate with specific areas in Lawrence?</em></h5>
            <p>
                Upon investigating the heatmap, I noticed a pattern. The planting rates across Lawrence seemed to be clustered, suggesting a strategic approach. Certain streets, specifically Market and Marion, stood out as focal points of this strategy, with trees consistently planted over 3+ years. This consistency prompted me to wonder: Is this a result of urban planning, or is it driven by demands from local residents? Though more data might provide a clearer picture, my decision to focus solely on the tree data led me to believe that the city might be targeting areas based on current tree counts.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5><em>Which streets or areas have the most diverse range of tree species?</em></h5>
            <p>
                I examined another dimension of the data: Which streets or areas in Lawrence have the most diverse range of tree species? I used the TreeMap as a guide in this exploration. Streets with larger rectangles signified more trees, while the darker shades indicated a higher genera diversity. Through this visualization, I identified streets in Lawrence that not only had a large number of trees but also boasted a diverse range of species. This insight drove my subsequent analysis on the distribution of the top 10 streets and 10 top genera.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5><em>How has the distribution of the top 10 tree species evolved in the most populated streets of Lawrence over the past five years? Do the top 10 streets show a pattern of favoring certain species over the years? </em></h5>
            <p>I then delved into the distribution of the top 10 tree species in Lawrence’s most populated streets over the past five years. While the distribution shifted from year to year, I discerned a subtle pattern. Streets seemed to have a preference, or perhaps a suitability, for specific tree species. For example, in 2019, Acer, Ulmus, and Tilia were prevalent in 3 of the top 10 streets. This trend was also evident in 2018. Although this pattern might suggest geographic factors influencing tree choices, more detailed statistical analysis would be needed to validate this hypothesis.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h5><em>How does this correlate with the overall tree planting rate in the city?</em></h5>
            <p>Finally, I sought to understand how these species distributions correlated with the overall tree planting rate in the city. My findings further cemented the idea that Lawrence, in specific years, leaned towards planting similar tree types across different locations. This could be indicative of broader city-level decisions or environmental factors influencing tree choice.</p>
        
            <p>
                In conclusion, my deeper dive into Lawrence's tree data unearthed patterns that were both intriguing. I began by looking at the Temporal, Geospatial, and Species data. This way I could see what each one of these dimensions of the data had to offer. This in turn motivated me to ask questions about the connections between these dimensions leading to visualizations and commentarty you see above in the Tableau Story. The city's approach to tree planting, the streets that stood out in their green densities, and the subtle preferences in tree species choice all came together to weave a captivating tale of Lawrence's urban Tree spread.

<h1>Reflection</h1>

<h5>Data Processing and Transformation</h5>
<p>The initial phase of my project was important, laying the groundwork for all subsequent analyses. The tree data had a lot of missing values, and poorly labeled ones so I had to clean it. One task that stood out was refining the street names. The complexity of this process was underscored by the iterative Python scripts I coded. These scripts not only helped in standardizing the street names but also played an instrumental role in other preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values and segregating tree species. Another instance I used Python was to split the species name into the genus and species. This way I could use the genus instead of the species in my analysis, because the species column had verbal misspellings and other issues. A third instance was assigning a date to the trees that only had a year. I chose to use the 1st of January of that year, so I could process the data by year at least on Tableau. There were instances where certain data transformation strategies were contemplated, such as outlier treatments and advanced categorizations. However, some of these did not transition to the final workbook. The primary reason behind these exclusions was my commitment to preserving the integrity and authenticity of the original data, ensuring that my analyses remained true to Lawrence's tree landscape, and the data set I was given. With further analysis and more experience this project could be revisited, possibly providing richer insights.</p>

<h5>Data Exploration</h5>
<p>My strategy to analyze and visualize this data was simple. Begin by exploring any changes over time, geospatial data, and species data. This way I have an understanding of some key dimensions. Then after taking this understanding, attempting to find relationships between all these dimensions. However, even to get to the last phase my initial visualizations were filled with challenges.

    One prominent hurdle was the geospatial clustering based on latitude and longitude. While the idea was to visualize tree densities in distinct neighborhoods, achieving this proved more intricate than anticipated due to software constraints. This limitation led us to a crossroads: should I pursue a workaround or pivot to a different visualization approach?
   
    Another issue arose when I attempted to understand species diversity. The sheer variety of tree species planted in Lawrence posed a categorization challenge. Deciding on how to effectively group and visualize them without oversimplifying or complicating the narrative required multiple iterations. 
   
   Furthermore, the nested pie chart, intended to depict the dominance of certain species, took several tweaks before it effectively conveyed the desired insights. I also grappled with the balance between providing comprehensive data and avoiding information overload for the viewer. 
   
   Lastly, while diving deep into street-level data, inconsistencies in street naming conventions surfaced. This prompted a revisit to the data processing phase, underlining the iterative nature of data exploration. 
   
   Once these issues were taken care of I was able to ask more interesting questions about the data, which you can see in the Tableau story. Those visualizations were complex and required a lot more thinking and planning, but I was able to gather some interesting insight from them as you saw above.
   </p>

<h5>Data Storytelling</h5>
<p>
    As mentioned many times before, in the beginning, it was about setting the stage. Providing a backdrop of Lawrence's green spaces, I wanted the audience to visualize the city as how I saw it. However, merely presenting this data wasn't enough. The challenge lay in ensuring that the audience didn't just see numbers and charts but felt the pulsating growth of the city's green canopy.
As I progressed, I grappled with how to introduce complexity. The data set had a wealth of information on species diversity and geospatial distribution. How best to convey the changing landscape of tree species over time? Or the unique preferences of specific streets and areas? The TreeMap visualization emerged as a solution, enabling us to depict multiple dimensions in one visual.
Yet, it was crucial not to lose the human element. Behind every data point was a decision made by city planners, local communities, or environmentalists. The consistent planting on streets like Market and Marion hinted at urban planning decisions, perhaps driven by resident demands or environmental considerations. Revealing these subtle narratives within the broader story added depth to my analysis.
The storytelling phase also brought to the fore the importance of adaptability. While I had envisioned certain visualizations like the dual-axis map, I had to let them go, realizing that simplicity often trumps complexity. It was essential to ensure that the core message wasn't lost amidst intricate visuals.
In essence, our storytelling journey was a decision between the analytical and the artistic. It was about extracting truth from data, presenting it functionally, and wrapping it in a narrative that was both insightful and beautiful.

</p>


    <p><em>Truthfulness: </em> My visualizations have been made to ensure the accurate representation of the data. By refining street names, addressing null values, and consistently relying on the source data without introducing any alterations, I've maintained the data's integrity. I've consciously steered clear of exaggerations or underestimations, ensuring that the visualizations are a true reflection of Lawrence's tree landscape. Any potential for misleading scales or manipulations has been diligently avoided, ensuring the truthful representation of our data.</p>
    <p><em>Functionality: </em> The choice of visualization types was driven by the nature of the data and the message we aimed to convey. Line charts, bar graphs, and heat maps provided a comprehensive view of temporal trends. Geospatial visualizations, using clustering and density, revealed the distribution of trees in Lawrence. Nested pie charts and TreeMaps addressed species diversity, ensuring each visualization was functionally suited to its analytical task. </p>
    <p><em>Insight: </em> My visualizations have been designed not just to display data but to reveal meaningful patterns within. By segmenting and layering our data, I've been able to delve deeper into nuances, uncovering insights like the consistent tree planting trends on specific streets. </p>
    <p><em>Beautiful: </em> Design aesthetics played a pivotal role in our visualization journey. While ensuring clarity and simplicity, I've tried to create visuals that are engaging. Harmonious color hue have been employed, and design elements have been chosen to complement the data being presented. I've struck a balance between minimalistic design, ensuring visual clarity, and adding creative embellishments that enhance the overall user experience.</p>
